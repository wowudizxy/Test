    /// calls <see cref="BeginResolve"/>, which *synchronously* resolves the client's TCP port to its pid and
    /// captures its ancestor chain (names + ppids + interpreter command lines, up to MaxWalkDepth; a few ms,
    /// no-fork syscalls only) -- captured up front because short-lived intermediates (Codex's
    /// codex-command-runner.exe, `cmd /c` wrappers, MSYS fork shims) routinely exit together with the client
    /// and would be reaped before any async round -- and then walks the captured chain in-memory *right
    /// there*, so the resolved identity is usually in the cache before the request even leaves the accept
    /// thread. A single dedicated background thread remains only as the fallback for walks that run past the
    /// captured depth.
    /// The synchronous part exists because a short-lived, one-shot client process (bare `curl`, no keep-alive)
    /// can fully exit and be reaped before any purely-async worker gets a chance to look it up -- once it's
    /// gone, its ppid is unrecoverable. Results land in a short-TTL cache that any thread can read back via
    /// <see cref="TryGetAgentId"/> -- in particular, the main thread re-checks it right before writing
    /// audit/telemetry (well after the skill has executed), as a second safety net on top of the synchronous capture.
    ///
    /// Approach: a denylist, not an allowlist. Walking up from the client pid, any ancestor whose name is a
    /// shell/terminal-host/system-process/curl-like tool is skipped; the first ancestor NOT on that list is
